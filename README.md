# neuroGLM
Fitting and simulation of linear guassian and Poisson generalized linear model (GLM) for single neuron spike trains

**Description:**
computes estimates for the parameters of a Poisson GLM spike train model using ridge regressions and maximum-likelihood. 
Parameters consist of a stimulus temporal filter, a spike-history filter and a nonlinearity. 
This GLM model is a generalization of the "Linear-Nonlinear-Poisson" model that incorporates spike-history effects

**Installation:**
Tell other users how to install your project locally. Optionally, include a gif to make the process even more clear for other people.

**Usage:**
Examine test scripts in sub-directory tests/ to see simple scripts illustrating how to simulate and fit the GLM to spike train data.
