# neuroGLM
Fitting and simulation of linear guassian and Poisson generalized linear model (GLM) for single neuron spike trains

**Description:**
Simulates and computes maximum likelihood estimates for the parameters of a Poisson GLM spike train model. 
Parameters consist of a stimulus temporal filter, a spike-history filter. The stimulus filter can be parametrized linearly and the nonlinearity can be selected from a class ensuring convexity of the negative log-likelihood.  This GLM model is a generalization of the "Linear-Nonlinear-Poisson" model that incorporates spike-history effects.
